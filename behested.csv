The funds were provided by One Family LA, an initiative of Great Public Schools Now, which was started in March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic to provide direct financial assistance to Los Angeles families hardest hit by the economic fallout of COVID-19.

The donations will be distributed by appointment only and just in time to support families with their March rent and utility payments. Families will also be receiving a gift basket filled with facemasks, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies to help stop the spread of COVID-19.",3/15/2021,Charitable
