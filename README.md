# FPPC Behested Payment Scraper

The FPPC has [a webpage to download behested payments as an Excel file](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/transparency/form-700-filed-by-public-officials/behested-payments.html) but the data seems delayed, doesn't have all of the behested payments compared to other search tools, and has known errors.

All of the payments _do_ seem to be available by searching for particular politicans during particular years, such as [this search for payments behested by Gavin Newsom in 2024](https://dv.fppc.ca.gov/Detail?Year=2024&Name=Newsom,%20Gavin). This script searches all officials who reported behested payments since 2011 and saves them to [`behested.csv`](https://github.com/CalMatters/fppc-behested-payments/blob/main/behested.csv).

An example of a known error in the downloadable data is a $5,000,000,000 behested payment from the Waverley Street Foundation to California Volunteers in May 2024 though the FPPC's web tool for searching behested payments states that the value is $5,000,000, which makes a lot more sense and is used in this data set.
