# California Behested Payment Data

The California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), the state's ethics and money in politics watchdog, says that a [payment is behested](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/transparency/behested-payments.html) if it was made:
* At the request, suggestion, or solicitation of, or made in cooperation, consultation, coordination or concert with the public official; and
* For a legislative, governmental or charitable purpose.

The commission has [a webpage to download behested payments as an Excel file](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/transparency/form-700-filed-by-public-officials/behested-payments.html) but the data seems delayed and has known errors.

The FPPC has a web search tool for behested payments that doesn't seem to have the same issues as the downloadable Excel file. Here's an example of the web search tool: [payments behested by Gavin Newsom in 2024](https://dv.fppc.ca.gov/Detail?Year=2024&Name=Newsom,%20Gavin).

An example of a known error in the downloadable data is a $5,000,000,000 behested payment from the Waverley Street Foundation to California Volunteers in May 2024 though the FPPC's web tool for searching behested payments states that the value is $5,000,000, which makes a lot more sense and is used in this data set.

This dataset is simply one CSV with all the behested payments pulled from the correct web search tool. It spans 2011 through the present.
